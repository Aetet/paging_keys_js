h1. Paging Keys

h2. About

Keyboard short cuts for paging through listings one item at at time (and across entire pages).  Inspired by the navigation at "FFFFOUND!":http://ffffound.com/

The example operates on "micro-formatted":http://microformats.org/ html ( "hAtom":http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom ).  The script uses the "prototype":http://www.prototypejs.org/ js library and "hotkey.js":http://la.ma.la/blog/diary_200511041713.htm for key event hooks. Take a look at "this video explanation":http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1409-heres-a-demo-of-some-thoughtful-ui-on-ffffoundcom from "Ryan Singer":http://twitter.com/rjs of "37 Signals":http://www.37signals.com

Holy explanations Batman!, there is a "working demo here":http://homebrew.hiddenloop.com/sandbox/paging_keys/example.html

h2. Caveats

Ongoing issues with this script include;

* more testing on different browsers
* more testing coverage in general
* only works with prototype library right now (happy to accept patches for others)
* there are some places where CSS id selectors would suit better over class selectors
* so far manually tested on the following mac browsers; 
** Safari 3/4, FireFox 3/3.5, Opera 9+, Camino 1.6.9

h2. Setup / Using

h3. Requirements

What do you need?

* "prototype":http://www.prototypejs.org/ javascript library (>= 1.6.0.3)
* "hotkey.js":http://la.ma.la/blog/diary_200511041713.htm (included in paging_keys.js)
* a working keyboard and browser
* for the example - a sense of "1970's Batman humor":http://adamwest.tripod.com/b-lectur.htm

h3. Using

To use on your own website, simply;

* markup your entry titles with the following CSS hierarchy; .hentry h2 a.entry-title (the example uses the "hAtom":http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom style)
* include the prototype library javascript (e.g. from "ajax.googleapis.com":http://code.google.com/apis/ajax/)
* include the paging_keys.js javascript somewhere on your page
* add pagination html to each page as shown in the example (in "Rails":http://rubyonrails.org/, if you're using "will_paginate":http://wiki.github.com/mislav/will_paginate, you'll get this for free)
* optionally add the paging-nav element somewhere on each page, and include the CSS for it
* thats it! 

Make your browser height small enough to engage vertical scrolling, then use j/k to move up/down through listing (and across pagination).  You can also use h/l to move between pages. So;

* h previous page
* j previous item
* k next item
* l next page

h3. Configuration

The config variable in pagingKeys can be used to customize the class to suit your own HTML and CSS selectors.  See the comments alongside each attribute for more information. 

h3. Minimized

The YUI compressor was used to create paging_keys_min.js. pagingKeys can still be configured here, just scan through the code and find the config var.


h2. Example Configuration Explanation 

Four "micro-formatted":http://microformats.org/ ( "hAtom":http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom ) example pages with pagination links (in the "will_paginate":http://wiki.github.com/mislav/will_paginate style) The example uses the #bottom anchor link on the last post of each page, so paging backwards will start at the bottom and work its way up through the page.  Each example page has an optional paging navigation key at the top right corner (when javascript is available).  In the example, the "prototype":http://www.prototypejs.org/ library is loaded from "ajax.googleapis.com":http://code.google.com/apis/ajax/ (this is a good idea).

Have a look at the example html documents and the tests for more information.
