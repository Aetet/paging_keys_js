h1. Paging Keys (js)

h2. About

Javascript keyboard short cutting for page navigation e.g. through listings. 

Both scrolling to articles on the current page and paginating through mutliple pages.  Inspired by the interaction on "FFFFOUND!":http://ffffound.com.  The example operates on "micro-formatted":http://microformats.org/ html ( "hAtom":http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom ).  The script uses the "prototype":http://www.prototypejs.org/ js library and includes code for  "hotkey.js":http://la.ma.la/blog/diary_200511041713.htm key hooks.

h2. Caveats

Ongoing issues with this script include;

* paging_keys_js should be re-written to be a self contained class
* more testing !
