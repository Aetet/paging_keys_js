h1. Paging Keys (js)

h2. About

Javascript keyboard short cutting for page navigation e.g. through listings. 

Both scrolling to articles on the current page and paginating through mutliple pages.  Inspired by the interaction on "FFFFOUND!":http://ffffound.com.  The example operates on "micro-formatted":http://microformats.org/ html ( "hAtom":http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom ).  The script uses the "prototype":http://www.prototypejs.org/ js library and includes code for  "hotkey.js":http://la.ma.la/blog/diary_200511041713.htm key hooks.

h2. Caveats

Ongoing issues with this script include;

* paging_keys_js should be re-written to be a self contained class
* more testing on different browsers and to get more coverage

h2. Setup / Using

h3. Requirements

What do you need?

* "prototype":http://www.prototypejs.org/ js library (>= 1.6.0.3)
* a working keyboard
* a decent web browser

h3. Using

In the example, make your browser height small enough to have vertical scrolling, then use j/k to move up/down through listing (and across pagination)  You can also use h/l to move between pages. So;

* *h* previous page
* *j* previous item

* *k* next item
* *l* next page

Obviously the example has only one page in it right now. So jumping cross pages yields a 404 (will fix this soon).

h2. Configuration

For now look at example.html and the tests.

h2. Example Configuration Explanation 

A "micro-formatted":http://microformats.org/ ( "hAtom":http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom ) blog page with pagination html from "will_paginate":http://wiki.github.com/mislav/will_paginate )

For now look at example.html and the tests.

h2. Get out clause
